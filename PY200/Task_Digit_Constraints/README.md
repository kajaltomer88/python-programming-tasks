# Task PY200 T6: Digit Constraints Problem 🔢

## 📌 Description

This Python program finds the smallest number x in the range 1 to N that satisfies the following conditions:

### ✅ Conditions:
- The sum of digits of x must be divisible by 7  
- The number must contain exactly two digit '3's  
- The number must NOT contain digit 0  

If no such number exists, the program prints -1.

## 🧠 Logic Used

- Loop from 1 to N  
- Convert number to string for digit validation  
- Use string functions like:
  - count() → To check number of 3s  
  - sum() → To calculate digit sum  
- Apply condition checking using a function
