# Electricity Bill Calculator ⚡

This Python program calculates the total electricity bill based on slab-wise unit consumption.

The user enters the number of units consumed, and the program:

- Applies different rates for different unit slabs  
- Calculates the total amount step-by-step  
- Adds a fixed service charge  
- Displays the final electricity bill  

This project was created as part of my Python practice to improve logical thinking and conditional statements.
